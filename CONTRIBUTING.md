## Getting Started

### 1. Fork & Clone

git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/codereview-ai.git
cd codereview-ai
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Setup Your Environment

PRism AI includes a **Setup Wizard** that makes configuration easy:

1. Copy the example env file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Open your browser at http://localhost:3000

4. Follow the Setup Wizard which will guide you through:
   - Creating a Supabase project (free tier is enough)
   - Getting a Claude API key from Anthropic
   - Setting up GitHub OAuth for authentication
   - Running database migrations

5. After setup completes, restart the dev server:
   ```bash
   # Press Ctrl+C to stop
   npm run dev
   ```

That's it! You're ready to start contributing.
